# Godot SWE Ocean 2D Simulation
Welcome to the Godot SWE Ocean 2D Simulation project! This repository contains a 2D fluid dynamics simulation based on the Shallow Water Equations (SWE), implemented using the Godot Engine. The project aims to simulate realistic ocean waves and fluid behavior for educational purposes and game development.

## Features
* Realistic Wave Simulation: Leverage the power of Shallow Water Equations to simulate dynamic and realistic ocean waves in a 2D environment. (Based on Real-time Simulation of Large Bodies of Water with Small Scale Details
