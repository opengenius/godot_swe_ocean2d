# Godot SWE Ocean 2D Simulation
Welcome to the Godot SWE Ocean 2D Simulation project! This repository contains a 2D fluid dynamics simulation based on the Shallow Water Equations (SWE), implemented using the Godot Engine. The project aims to simulate realistic ocean waves and fluid behavior for educational purposes and game development.
